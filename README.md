# 2000 Years of Economic History Visualized

A Jupyter notebook visualizing the relative GDP and population data between 11 major world powers from 1 - 2021 AD.

## Description

This data visualization experiment was inspired by a [graph titled "2,000 Years of Economic History in One Chart", published by VisualCapitalist in 2017](/https://www.visualcapitalist.com/2000-years-economic-history-one-chart/). It seeks to correct the original's distorted x-axis which obscures the temporal characteristics (i.e. compressed duration) of Western economic dominance relative to Asia in the past 2000 years of recorded data.

Additionally, the graph has been updated to include 2021 GDP (PPP) data. Feel free to update and disseminate it as new data becomes available.

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook file, the excel database file (source: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-database-2010), and two image files containing the output of the code.
